# 🌐 Google Cloud DNS Setup Complete!

## ✅ What I've Set Up For You:

### 1. Google Cloud DNS Zone Created
- Zone Name: `krakengaming-zone`
- Domain: `krakengaming.org`

### 2. DNS Records Created
- **krakengaming.org** → Google Cloud Run (A record)
- **preview.krakengaming.org** → Google Cloud Run (CNAME)
- **api.krakengaming.org** → Google Cloud Run (CNAME) - Future use

### 3. Google Nameservers Assigned
```
ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com
ns-cloud-e2.googledomains.com
ns-cloud-e3.googledomains.com
ns-cloud-e4.googledomains.com
```

## 🚀 What You Need To Do Next:

### Step 1: Update Your Domain Registrar
Go to your domain registrar (where you bought krakengaming.org) and change the nameservers to:
```
ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com
ns-cloud-e2.googledomains.com
ns-cloud-e3.googledomains.com
ns-cloud-e4.googledomains.com
```

### Step 2: Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- You can check propagation status at: https://www.whatsmydns.net/

### Step 3: Domain Verification & Mapping
Once nameservers are updated, I can help you:
1. Verify domain ownership with Google
2. Create Cloud Run domain mappings
3. Enable automatic SSL certificates

## 📋 Current Status

### ✅ Completed:
1. **Nameservers Updated** - You've switched to Google nameservers
2. **DNS Records Created** - All records configured in Google Cloud DNS
3. **HTTPS Redirects Added** - Automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirects implemented
4. **Security Headers** - Added comprehensive security headers
5. **Application Rebuilding** - New version with HTTPS support deploying

### ⏳ In Progress:
- DNS propagation (24-48 hours typical)
- Application rebuild with HTTPS support

### 🚀 Next Actions (Once DNS Propagates):
1. **Verify DNS propagation**: Check if `nslookup krakengaming.org` shows Google IPs
2. **Create domain mappings**: Run the setup script
3. **Test HTTPS redirects**: Verify HTTP automatically redirects to HTTPS
4. **SSL certificate verification**: Confirm certificates are active

### 🛠️ Ready-to-Run Scripts:
- `scripts/setup-domain-mappings.sh` - Run after DNS propagates
- `scripts/deploy-with-https.sh` - For future deployments

## 🔒 HTTPS & Security Setup - ✅ CONFIGURED!

### Automatic HTTPS Redirect
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added Next.js middleware for automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirects
- Redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS with 301 status
- Only active in production environment
- Includes security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### SSL Certificates
- ✅ Google automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains
- ✅ Certificates auto-renew before expiration
- ✅ Supports multiple domains and wildcards

### Security Headers Added:
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

## 💰 Cost
- Google Cloud DNS: $0.50/month per hosted zone
- DNS queries: $0.40 per million queries

## 🔧 Benefits You'll Get:
- ✅ Integrated domain management
- ✅ Automatic SSL certificates
- ✅ Global CDN performance
- ✅ Easy subdomain management
- ✅ Programmatic DNS control
- ✅ Built-in monitoring
