   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìã Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Enable strict mode** - we use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Prefer explicit types** over `any`
- **Use meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes

### Code Style

- **Use Prettier** for code formatting (configured in the project)
- **Follow ESLint rules** (configured in the project)
- **Use camelCase** for variables and functions
- **Use PascalCase** for classes and components
- **Use kebab-case** for file names

### React/Next.js

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Follow Next.js App Router** conventions
- **Use TypeScript interfaces** for props
- **Implement proper error boundaries**
- **Optimize for performance** (use React.memo, useMemo, etc.)

### Backend

- **Use Fastify plugins** for modularity
- **Implement proper error handling**
- **Use Zod schemas** for validation
- **Add comprehensive API documentation**
- **Follow REST conventions**

### Database

- **Use Prisma migrations** for schema changes
- **Add proper indexes** for performance
- **Use transactions** for data consistency
- **Follow database naming conventions**

## üß™ Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Write tests** for new features
- **Maintain test coverage** above 80%
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Use appropriate test types**:
  - Unit tests for individual functions
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - E2E tests for critical user flows

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests for specific workspace
npm run test -w @krakengaming/backend

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
